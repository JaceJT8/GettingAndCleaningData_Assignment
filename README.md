Coursera: Getting And Cleaning Data - End of Course Assignment

This repository contains the code and instructions for use of a prgram written to clean and analyse data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Files contained in the repository:

1: Analysis script: Run_analysis.R - performs the following functions:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


2: Codebook: This describes the original data collected and the stages of processing contained within Run_analysis.R

3. FinalData.txt: This text file contains the final cleaned dataset generated by Runa_analysis.R
